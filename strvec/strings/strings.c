 * 1. >  strlen("") = 0
 * 2. >  strlen("ilovecs33") = 9

/*
 * strncpy() - abbreviated from "string copy (n bytes)".
 * - Description: copies the first n bytes of the contents of the source string
 *   into the location of the destination string. As with strcpy(), we are
 *   assuming the destimation string is large enough to hold the entire
 *   contents of the source string. If the number of bytes to be copied is less
 *   than the number of bytes in the src string, the null character will
 *   not be copied. If the number of bytes to be copied is longer than the
 *   length of src, the difference will be padded with null characters appended
 *   onto the end of dest to fill out the requested in bytes.
 *
 * - Arguments: a pointer (char *) to the destination string, a pointer
 *   (char *) to the source string, and the number of bytes (size_t) to copy.
 *
 * - Return value: a pointer (char *) to the destination string.
 *
 * - Usage:
 *
 *      char abbreviation[5];
 *      strncpy(abbreviation, "professor", 4);
 *
 *      (The variable abbreviation now contains the four bytes of "prof", but
 *      it is not null-terimated.)
 *
 *      char buffer[10];
 *
 *      strncpy(buffer, "brown", 10);
 *
 *      (The variable buffer now contains the five bytes of "brown" followed by
 *      five null characters.)
 *
 *      char good_fit[5];
 *
 *      strncpy(good_fit, "okay", 5);
 *
 *      (The variable good_fit now contains the four bytes of "okay" and is
 *      correctly null-terminated.)
 *
 * - Hint: make sure not to modify the source string. Please pay attention to
 * the function description to see what is expected of your implementation.

 * strstr() - abbreviated from "string (find) string".
 * - Description: Find the string "needle" in the string "haystack". This is

 * (needle), and a pointer to anull-terminated character string in which to find
 * the string (haystack)
 *
 * - Return value: a pointer to the beginning of the needle string within the
 * haystack string
 *
 * Examples:
 * 1. >  strstr("abcde", "bcd"); should return pointer to string starting @ b
 * 2. >  strstr("123456", "4"); should return pointer to string starting @ 4
 * 3. >  strstr("hello", "xyz") = NULL
